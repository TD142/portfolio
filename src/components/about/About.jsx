            Hi my name's Thomas, and I am a creative developer with a background
            in music.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            My love and journey into web development started from my passion for
            music - both fields use a complex source (music notation / code) to
            present beautiful outputs, whether visually or audibly.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            I believe it is my creativity which sets me apart in this field as
            my whole life I have looked for new ways of doing things, whether
            itâ€™s through music, logical thinking or coding.
          </p>
