            Hi my name's Thomas, and I am a creative developer with a background
            in music. My love and journey into web development started from my
            passion for music - both fields use a complex source (music notation
            / code) to present beautiful outputs, whether visually or audibly. I
            believe it is my creativity which sets me apart in this field as my
            whole life I have looked for new ways of doing things, whether itâ€™s
            through music, logical thinking or coding.
          </p>
